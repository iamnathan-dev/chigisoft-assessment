This is a sophisticated [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), implementing modern web development practices and architectural patterns.

## Getting Started

To begin development, ensure you have Node.js (v18.17.0 or higher) and pnpm installed. Then, run the development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server with hot-reload
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The development server includes features like Fast Refresh for instantaneous feedback during development.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture with the following structure:

```

├── app/                   # App Router pages and layouts
│   ├── (auth)/           # Authentication related routes
│   └── (shop)/           # Main shop application routes
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/          # Shared components
│   └── ui/              # Basic UI elements
├── config/              # Application configuration
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                 # Utility functions and libraries
├── providers/           # React context providers
├── services/           # External service integrations
├── store/              # State management
├── styles/             # Global styles and Tailwind config
└── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 13+ with App Router
